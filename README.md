# Lottery Game Smart Contract

This repository contains a lottery game smart contract written in SmartPy, a high-level smart contract programming language. The smart contract implements a simple lottery game where participants can purchase tickets by sending a certain amount of tez (XTZ) to the contract's address. The contract randomly selects a winner at the end of a specified time period, and transfers the prize money to the winner's address.

The smart contract is designed to be secure and transparent, with all transactions and lottery results recorded on the blockchain. The contract also includes various features to prevent fraud and ensure fairness, such as limiting the number of tickets that can be purchased per participant, and using a secure random number generator to select the winner.

The repository contains the source code for the smart contract, along with detailed documentation and test cases. The contract has been thoroughly tested and audited to ensure compliance with the CS 173 course guidelines, and to minimize the risk of potential vulnerabilities.

# How to Use

To use the lottery game smart contract, users can interact with the contract's address using any Tezos wallet that supports smart contract interactions. Participants can purchase tickets by sending a specified amount of XTZ to the contract's address, and can view the current status of the lottery, including the number of tickets sold and the current prize amount.

Once the lottery period has ended, the contract will automatically select a winner and transfer the prize money to the winner's address. Participants can verify the results of the lottery by checking the transaction history on the blockchain.
